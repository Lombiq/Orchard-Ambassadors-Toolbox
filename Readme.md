### Orchard Ambassadors Orchard Core introductory talk template

Do you want to give a talk at a meetup or conference about Orchard Core? Here is a PowerPoint template to help you get going, as well as various tips on how to conduct the talk. Do add your personal touch to it and adapt it to the given occasion of course!

Clone the repository and check out the [*IntroductoryTalkTemplate* folder](IntroductoryTalkTemplate).

What's in here?

- A PowerPoint template with slides to give you a generic talk outline. All the slides have notes too, so be sure to check them out.
- A [demo outline](IntroductoryTalkTemplate/DemoOutline.md) to help you conduct a demo.
- [Snippets](IntroductoryTalkTemplate/Snippets.txt) to quickly use during a demo instead of having to type everything live.
- A [session checklist](IntroductoryTalkTemplate/Checklist.md) that you can follow just before you conduct the talk to make sure you have everything prepared.

Note that if you want to present all the demo content than it'll take about 3 hours and is thus more suitable for a longer workshop. If you want to give a 45-minute lighter talk then you need to cut the demos or other content shorter. [Here's our Showcasing Orchard Core CMS video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfy5SCACyL8) also based on this template.

This template assumes that you're not completely new to giving talks. If you are then search for resources on being a good presenter, but the following should get you going: [11 Top Tips for a Successful Technical Presentation](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/11TopTipsForASuccessfulTechnicalPresentation.aspx) and 
[Tips for Preparing for a Technical Presentation](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/TipsForPreparingForATechnicalPresentation.aspx) by Scott Hanselman, and [Speaker style bingo: 10 presentation anti-pattern](https://www.troyhunt.com/speaker-style-bingo-10-presentation/) by Troy Hunt.
