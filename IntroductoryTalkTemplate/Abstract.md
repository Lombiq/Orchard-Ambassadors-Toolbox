**Showcasing Orchard Core CMS**

Are you developing .NET web apps and are tired of reinventing the wheel with every project? Use a modern foundation to build on instead! In this session, we'll do a quick dive into working with the modern ASP.NET Core framework and web content management system (CMS) Orchard Core. We'll see what Orchard can provide you, how it goes beyond simple content management, and why you'd want to join such a cutting-edge open-source community.

This talk aims to answer the following questions:

- Why would I use a CMS as a .NET web developer?
- What does Orchard Core (https://www.orchardcore.net/) provide me?
- How can I use Orchard, how can I develop my own modules for it?
- Why would I join such an open-source community, why does it help my professional development?

Keywords: web, CMS, .NET, ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core MVC, MVC, C#, Orchard Core

This talk is for you if:

- You're a .NET developer but haven't worked with the web yet.
- You're a .NET web developer and don't want to continue reinventing the wheel with a home-grown framework, or would like to use a different CMS instead of your current one.
- You're a developer at the beginning of your carrier, who would like to try yourself in a real, large .NET project, as a member of an open-source community.
