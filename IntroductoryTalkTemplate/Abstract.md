**Showcasing Orchard Core CMS**

A quick dive into working with Orchard Core CMS in web projects.

This talk aims to answer the following questions:

- Why would I use a CMS (Content Management System) as a .NET (Core) web developer?
- What does Orchard Core (https://www.orchardcore.net/) provide me?
- How can I use Orchard, how can I develop my own modules for it?
- Why would I join such an open-source community, why does it help my professional development?

Keywords: CMS, .NET Core, ASP.NET Core MVC, C#

This talk is for you if:

- You're a .NET developer but haven't worked with the web yet.
- You're a .NET web developer and you don't want to continue to reinvent the wheel with a home-grown framework, or would like to use a different CMS instead of your current one.
- You're a developer in the beginning of your carrier, who would like to try themselves in a real, large .NET project, as a member of an open-source community.
